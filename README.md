I am well aware that the challenge description mentioned dogs, but since I'm more of a cat person myself,
I felt like there needed to be some representation from the kitten crowd. Nothing fancy here,
as I decided against pulling in a lot of external libraries to pull data from a remote source -
there is a fake loading screen to simulate this, however!

That being said, while I have worked with Jetpack Compose before (around the time of Alpha 5 or so),
this is the first time using the first-party Compose Navigation component.
